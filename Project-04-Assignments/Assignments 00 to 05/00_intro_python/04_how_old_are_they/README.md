# **🎂 04_how_old_are_they – Age Calculation Program 🕰️**  

## **📌 Overview**  
This Python script calculates the ages of five individuals—Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, and Ethan—using simple arithmetic relationships. 🧮👥  

## **🖥️ Code Explanation**  
- **📍 Assigns an initial age** to Anton (21 years).  
- **➕ Uses mathematical operations** to determine the ages of the others based on given conditions:  
  - Beth is 6 years older than Anton.  
  - Chen is 20 years older than Beth.  
  - Drew's age is the sum of Chen's and Anton's.  
  - Ethan's age is the same as Chen's.  
- **📊 Prints the calculated ages** of all five individuals.  

## **🚀 How to Run**  
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
2. Navigate to the script directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Project-4-Assignments/Assignments 00 to 05/00_intro_python/04_how_old_are_they/
   ```  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
4. The program will display the calculated ages of Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, and Ethan. 🎉✅  

This exercise strengthens **basic arithmetic operations and variable assignments** in Python! 🚀🔢
