# **📊 AVERAGES - FUNCTION DESCRIPTION**  

### **🔢 Functionality**  
This program defines an `average` function that calculates the midpoint between two numbers. It then demonstrates its use by computing averages step by step.  

### **📝 How It Works?**  
1. The `average(a, b)` function takes two numbers and returns their average:  
   \[
   \text{average} = \frac{a + b}{2}
   \]
2. In the `main()` function:  
   - It first calculates `avg_1` (average of 0 and 10).  
   - Then, `avg_2` (average of 8 and 10).  
   - Finally, it computes `final` by averaging `avg_1` and `avg_2`.  

### **📌 Output Example**  
```
avg_1: 5.0  
avg_2: 9.0  
final: 7.0  
```

🚀 A simple and effective way to find midpoints!
