### **🛠 How It Works?**  

✅ **`print_multiple(message, repeats)`**  
- Uses a loop to print the **message** `repeats` times.

✅ **`main()`**  
1. **Takes user input** for a message.  
2. **Ensures valid input** for the number of repetitions.  
3. Calls `print_multiple()` to **display the message**.
