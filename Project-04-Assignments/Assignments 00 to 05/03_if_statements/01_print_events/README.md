# 🖨️ **01 - Print Even Numbers**  

A simple Python script that prints the first **20 even numbers** using a loop.  

## 📝 **Code Explanation**  
🔹 **Loop from 0 to 19** → Runs 20 times to generate 20 even numbers.  
🔹 **Multiply by 2** → Ensures only even numbers are printed.  
🔹 **`main()` function** → Encapsulates the logic for structured execution.  
🔹 **`if __name__ == "__main__":`** → Ensures the script runs only when executed directly.

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HadiqaGohar/Project-4-Assignments.git
