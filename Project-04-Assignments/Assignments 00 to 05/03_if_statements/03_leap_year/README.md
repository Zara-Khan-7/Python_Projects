# 📅 **03 - Leap Year Checker**  

A Python script that determines whether a given year is a **leap year** based on standard rules.  

## 📝 **Code Explanation**  
🔹 **User Input** → Prompts the user to enter a year.  
🔹 **Leap Year Conditions** → A year is a leap year if:  
   - It is **divisible by 4** ✅ **AND** **not divisible by 100**, unless  
   - It is **also divisible by 400** ✅  
🔹 **Conditional Logic** → Uses `if-else` statements to check these conditions.  
🔹 **Encapsulated in `main()`** → Ensures a clean and structured execution.  
🔹 **`if __name__ == '__main__':`** → Runs the script only when executed directly.  

## 🚀 **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HadiqaGohar/Project-4-Assignments.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the script folder:  
   ```bash
   cd Project-4-Assignments/03_if_statements/03_leap_year
   ```  
3. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
4. Enter a year when prompted and see if it's a leap year!
