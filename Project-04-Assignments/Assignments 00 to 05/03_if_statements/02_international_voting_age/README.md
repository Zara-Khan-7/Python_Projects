# 🗳️ **02 - International Voting Age Checker**  

A Python script that checks if a user is **eligible to vote** in three different countries based on their age.  

## 📝 **Code Explanation**  
🔹 **Predefined voting ages** → Each country has a different voting age:  
   - 🇵🇪 **Peturksbouipo** → 16 years  
   - 🇸🇹 **Stanlau** → 25 years  
   - 🇲🇾 **Mayengua** → 48 years  
🔹 **User input** → The script asks for the user's age.  
🔹 **Conditional checks** → Compares the user's age against each country's voting age and prints eligibility.  
🔹 **Encapsulated in `main()`** → Ensures clean execution structure.  
🔹 **`if __name__ == '__main__':`** → Runs the script only when executed directly.  

## 🚀 **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HadiqaGohar/Project-4-Assignments.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the script folder:  
   ```bash
   cd Project-4-Assignments/03_if_statements/02_international_voting_age
   ```  
3. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
4. Enter your age when prompted and see in which countries you are eligible to vote!
