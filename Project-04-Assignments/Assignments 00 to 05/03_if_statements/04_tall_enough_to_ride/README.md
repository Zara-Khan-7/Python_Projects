# 🎢 **04 - Tall Enough to Ride**  

A Python script that checks if a user is **tall enough** to ride a roller coaster based on a minimum height requirement.  

## 📝 **Code Explanation**  
🔹 **Predefined Minimum Height** → `50` (arbitrary units).  
🔹 **User Input** → Prompts the user to enter their height.  
🔹 **Conditional Check** → Compares the entered height with the minimum required height.  
   - ✅ **Tall enough?** → `"You're tall enough to ride!"`  
   - ❌ **Too short?** → `"You're not tall enough to ride, but maybe next year!"`  
🔹 **Encapsulated in `main()`** → Ensures structured execution.  
🔹 **`if __name__ == '__main__':`** → Runs the script only when executed directly.  

## 🚀 **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HadiqaGohar/Project-4-Assignments.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the script folder:  
   ```bash
   cd Project-4-Assignments/03_if_statements/04_tall_enough_to_ride
   ```  
3. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
4. Enter your height when prompted and check if you can ride!
