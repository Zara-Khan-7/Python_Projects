# 🎲 **Dice Simulator – Roll the Dice & Test Your Luck! 🎲**  

## **📌 Overview**  
This Python program **simulates rolling two dice** and prints their total. It uses the `random` module to generate random values between **1 and 6** for each die. Additionally, it demonstrates **variable scope** by maintaining a separate variable inside the `main()` function.  

## **💡 Features**  
✔️ Simulates rolling **two six-sided dice** 🎲  
✔️ Rolls the dice **three times** in a loop 🔄  
✔️ Demonstrates **local and global scope** of variables in Python  

## **📝 Code Explanation**  
1. **`roll_dice()` Function:**  
   - Generates two random numbers between **1 and 6** 🎲  
   - Prints the values of both dice and their total  
2. **`main()` Function:**  
   - Declares a local variable `die1` (set to **10**) to demonstrate **variable scope**  
   - Calls `roll_dice()` three times  
   - Prints `die1` to show its **value remains unchanged** inside `main()`  

## **🚀 How to Run**  
1. **Navigate to the directory**  
   ```bash
   cd Project-4-Assignments/Assignments\ 00\ to\ 05/01_expressions/01_dicesimulator/
   ```  
2. **Run the program**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  
3. **Check the output** and see how the dice roll each time! 🎉  

## **🎯 Learning Outcomes**  
✅ Using `random.randint()` for random number generation  
✅ Understanding **function scope** in Python  
✅ Practicing **loops** to repeat actions
