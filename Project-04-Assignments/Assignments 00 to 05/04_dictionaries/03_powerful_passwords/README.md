# 🔐 **Powerful Passwords: Secure Login System**  

A Python program that securely verifies passwords using **SHA256 hashing**.  

## 🛠 **How It Works**  
1. **Password Hashing**: Uses SHA256 to store passwords securely.  
2. **Login Verification**: Checks if an entered password matches the stored hash.  
3. **Predefined Users**: A dictionary maps emails to their hashed passwords.  

## 🚀 **Usage**  
Run the script in a terminal:  
```bash
python main.py
```  
- Enter a test email and password.  
- The system verifies if the password is correct.  

## 🔑 **Features**  
✅ Uses **SHA256 hashing** for security  
✅ **Dictionary-based storage** for logins  
✅ **Case-sensitive verification**  
✅ **Predefined test cases** to demonstrate login functionality  

📌 **Ideal for learning about password hashing and user authentication!** 😊
