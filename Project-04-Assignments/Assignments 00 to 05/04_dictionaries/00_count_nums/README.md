# 🔢 **Count Numbers Assignment**  

A Python script that counts the occurrences of numbers entered by the user using **dictionaries**.  

## 📝 **How It Works**  
1. **User Input**: Enter numbers one by one.  
2. **Counting**: The script uses a dictionary to count occurrences.  
3. **Output**: Displays the frequency of each number in sorted order.  

## 🚀 **Usage**  
Run the script in a terminal:  
```bash
python main.py
```  
- Enter numbers (press **Enter** on a blank line to stop).  
- Get a summary of how many times each number appears!  

## 🛠 **Functions Used**  
- `get_user_numbers()`: Collects numbers from the user.  
- `count_numbers(num_list)`: Counts occurrences using a dictionary.  
- `print_counts(num_dict)`: Displays the results in sorted order.  

📌 **Simple, efficient, and beginner-friendly!** 😊
