# 🎮 **Control Flow for Console - High-Low Game**  

This Python script implements a **High-Low Guessing Game**, demonstrating the use of **loops, conditionals, and user input validation**. The game consists of **five rounds**, where the player must guess whether their randomly generated number is **higher or lower** than the computer's.

### 🔹 **How the Game Works:**  
1️⃣ The game starts with a **welcome message** and initializes a score counter.  
2️⃣ In each round:  
   - A **random number (1-100) is assigned to the player**.  
   - The **computer also generates a random number**.  
   - The player **guesses whether their number is higher or lower** than the computer’s.  
3️⃣ The program checks if the player's guess is **correct** and updates the score accordingly.  
4️⃣ The game repeats for **five rounds**.  
5️⃣ At the end, the program **displays the player's final score** and provides a message based on their performance.

### 🛠 **Key Features & Concepts Used:**  
✅ **Random Number Generation** – Uses Python’s `random.randint()` to generate numbers.  
✅ **Looping & Iteration** – Runs the game for a fixed number of rounds using a `for` loop.  
✅ **User Input & Validation** – Ensures the player enters a valid response (`higher` or `lower`).  
✅ **Conditional Logic** – Checks if the player’s guess is correct and updates the score.  
✅ **Score Tracking** – Keeps track of the player's correct guesses and provides feedback at the end.

### 🏆 **Final Score Messages:**  
🌟 **Perfect Score:** "Wow! You played perfectly!" (All guesses correct)  
💡 **Good Score:** "Good job, you played really well!" (At least half correct)  
😅 **Needs Improvement:** "Better luck next time!" (Less than half correct)  

🚀 **Play, practice, and improve your guessing skills!**
