# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Pattern Generator in Python

This is a simple Python program that prints a **diamond pattern** made of asterisks (`*`) using loops and string multiplication. It's great for learning nested loops and basic string operations in Python.

---

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Takes a fixed height (can be changed)
- Prints a centered diamond shape using `*`
- Uses `for` loops and string repetition (`*` operator)

## ðŸ§¾ Code Overview

```python
def diamond_pattern():
    num = 5  # Change this value to increase/decrease the size of the diamond

    # Upper half of the diamond
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        print(" " * (num - i) + "*" * (2 * i - 1))

    # Lower half of the diamond
    for i in range(num - 1, 0, -1):
        print(" " * (num - i) + "*" * (2 * i - 1))

# Run the function
diamond_pattern()
